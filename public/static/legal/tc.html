    <p class="c149"><span class="c1">December 19 / Version: 2.0 </span></p>
    <p class="c32"><span class="c1">1. General </span></p>
    <p class="c15"><span class="c1">1.1. Service/scope </span></p>
    <p class="c77"><span class="c1">WAYA </span><span class="c28">MULTI LINK TECHNOLOGY </span><span class="c1">(hereinafter referred to as &lsquo;WAYA&rsquo;) is a Nigerian limited liability company headquartered in Lagoa Nigeria. </span></p>
    <p class="c145"><span class="c1">WAYA offers private customers (hereinafter referred to as &lsquo;customers&rsquo;) a mobile payment application for the iOS and Android operating systems (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;WAYA app&rdquo;) and Web based application. </span></p>
    <p class="c153"><span class="c1">The WAYA app can be used by customers as a means of payment in the area of stationary retail, at vending machines, in online shops and in apps and can thus be used with all merchants or service providers that accept WAYA as a payment method (hereinafter referred to as &lsquo;merchants&rsquo;). WAYA also offers added-value services. These include, in particular, the saving or activation of customer loyalty cards and services in the area of mobile marketing. These added-value services allow customers to receive and manage coupons, stamp cards and other campaigns in the WAYA app. Customers can likewise use these services to collect stamps and redeem loyalty rewards, discounts and credits via the WAYA app. </span></p>
    <p class="c43"><span class="c1">All personal designations apply to both genders equally. </span></p>
    <p class="c55"><span class="c1">These General Terms and Conditions (hereinafter referred to as the &lsquo;GTCs&rsquo;) govern the use of all services offered in the WAYA app. These services include all payment functions and added-value services, which are described on the website www.wayapaychat.com and in the WAYA app itself (hereinafter referred to as &lsquo;services&rsquo;). These GTCs shall be deemed to have been accepted as soon as customers register via the WAYA app and confirm with the click of the mouse that they have read and understood the GTCs. </span></p>
    <p class="c141"><span class="c1">1.2. Access to the WAYA services </span></p>
    <p class="c103"><span class="c1">The services can be used on all smartphones and general SMS/text message capable phones available on the Nigerian market, irrespective of the manufacturer, on which the WAYA app can be installed. For the WAYA app to be installed on a smartphone, it must be equipped with the iOS or Android operating system, support BLE (Bluetooth low energy) and have correctly implemented the Bluetooth protocol. The minimum required iOS or Android version can be found at www.wayapaychat.com or in the relevant app store. </span></p>
    <p class="c85"><span class="c1">Customers with a smartphone registered in their name on which the WAYA app has been installed are granted access to the services. </span></p>
    <p class="c148 c172"><span class="c1">Technical access to the services is obtained via the Internet connection of the customer&rsquo;s smartphone, which acts as a personal terminal, and a dedicated infrastructure made available by a business customer (e.g. Beacons &ndash; transmitters based on the BLE wireless standard). Certain services cannot be used in the absence of an Internet connection. </span></p>
    <p class="c93"><span class="c1">Payment and additional functions can be restricted by WAYA when used outside Nigeria on the basis of regulatory requirements. </span></p>
    <p class="c158"><span class="c1">1.3. Registration and identification </span></p>
    <p class="c121"><span class="c1">During the installation (downloading) of the WAYA app on the smartphone, customers shall be requested to enter their smartphone number. This number shall be verified for security reasons. Should customers change their mobile number, they must immediately inform WAYA of the new number. </span></p>
    <p class="c111"><span class="c1">1.4. Confidentiality </span></p>
    <p class="c69"><span class="c1">WAYA is bound by statutory confidentiality requirements. Customers shall accept that the nature of the business relationship and their master data (e.g. name, place of residence) may, where necessary, be disclosed to the payment recipient and other third parties in order to facilitate the provision of services. </span></p>
    <p class="c8"><span class="c1">Customers shall receive assurance that data relating to the content of business relationships (e.g. account and payment data) is in principle deemed confidential. However, customers shall acknowledge that the statutory duty of confidentiality may be waived in order to safeguard the legitimate interests of WAYA. This shall apply, in particular, in the following cases: </span></p>
  <ul>
<li>Instances in which WAYA is required to meet statutory obligations to provide information</li>
<li>For the collection of receivables of WAYA</li>
<li>Legal disputes</li>
   </ul>
   
    <p class="c58"><span class="c1">1.5. Support WAYA </span></p>
    <p class="c66"><span class="c1">WAYA shall provide customers with a help function via the WAYA app that offers technical support. WAYA can also call on third parties for the provision of this support. To enable them to perform this task, they may be granted access to relevant data. </span></p>
    <p class="c56"><span class="c1">1.6. Customer&rsquo;s duties of care </span></p>
    <p class="c90"><span class="c1">When using the WAYA app, the following duties of care, in particular, must be observed: </span></p>
    <ul>
            <li>Customers must protect their smartphone WAYA against unauthorised use or manipulation (e.g. by locking the device or display).</li>
            <li>The code for the use of the WAYA app, especially for the topping up and releasing of credit and the confirmation of payments above a certain amount, as well as the codes for the device and display locking functions, must be kept secret and must not be disclosed to other individuals under any circumstances or stored together with the smartphone. </li>
            <li>The selected code may not be made up of easily ascertainable combinations (mobile number, date of birth, etc.).</li>
            <li>Should damages be suffered, customers must, to the best of their knowledge, contribute to clarifying the case in question and mitigating the damage. In the event of criminal acts, customers must file a complaint to the police.</li>
           <li>Upon installing the WAYA app on their smartphone, customers shall confirm that they are the legitimate and authorised user of the smartphone number. Customers shall be deemed responsible for the use of their smartphone. They shall bear all consequences that arise from the use of the WAYA app on their smartphone. </li>
           <li>Should there be reason to assume that unauthorised individuals have gained access to the codes for the device and display locking functions, these must be changed immediately. </li>
            <li>If the smartphone is lost, and especially in the case of theft, WAYA must be informed promptly so that the WAYA app can be blocked. </li>
            <li>Jailbreaking (the deactivation of the smartphone&rsquo;s security structures for the installation of applications that are not officially available) and the setting up of root access (establishment of access at the system level of the smartphone) are forbidden, as is the installation of unauthorised apps, as these make the smartphone more prone to viruses and malware.</li>
            <li>Customers shall be required to check executed payments. Should Customers identify discrepancies, they must immediately inform WAYA by phone and provide written notification no later than thirty (30) days (postmark date) after the payment date. If customers are requested to submit a damage notification/complaint form, this must be completed and signed within ten (10) days (postmark date) of the request being made and returned to WAYA. </li>
          
        </ul>
          <p class="c142"><span class="c1">1.7. Misuse </span></p>
    <p class="c59"><span class="c1">If the use of the WAYA app deviates significantly from normal usage patterns or if there is any indication of behaviour that is illegal or in breach of the agreement, WAYA can encourage customers to use the app or in-app messaging and social media solution in a legally and contractually compliant manner, alter the provision of the service with no compensation or prior notification, terminate the agreement without notice and with no compensation and, where necessary, demand compensation for damages and indemnification against third party claims. The same shall apply in instances in which customers provide incorrect or incomplete details upon concluding the agreement. </span></p>
    <p class="c107"><span class="c1">1.8. Liability </span></p>
    <p class="c53"><span class="c1">Should WAYA breach the agreement, it shall assume liability for any demonstrable damages suffered by the customers in question unless it can prove that no fault can be attributed to it. WAYA shall assume no liability whatsoever for slight negligence. WAYA shall provide compensation for material damages and financial losses of up to a maximum of NGN 20,000 </span></p>
    <p class="c87"><span class="c1">To the extent permitted by law, WAYA shall not accept any liability for secondary damages, lost profits or data losses under any circumstances. WAYA shall likewise assume no liability for damages or losses suffered as a result of use of the WAYA app that is deemed illegal or in breach of the agreement. </span></p>
    <p class="c55"><span class="c1">Technical access to the services shall be the responsibility of the customer. WAYA shall assume no liability for the network operators (providers) and shall also not accept any liability, to the extent permitted by law, for the hardware and software required for the use of the services. </span></p>
    <p class="c139"><span class="c1">WAYA shall likewise, to the extent permitted by law, assume no liability for damages suffered by customers owing to transmission errors, force majeure, technical defects or faults (in particular due to outages suffered by WAYA Beacons or a lack of an Internet connection), illegal interference with telecommunication facilities and networks, network overloads, the deliberate blocking of electronic access by third parties, interruptions or other deficiencies. </span></p>
    <p class="c88"><span class="c1">WAYA shall endeavour to ensure the uninterrupted availability and fault-free usability of the WAYA app. WAYA cannot, however, guarantee this at all times. In particular, WAYA shall reserve the right to interrupt access to the WAYA app and/or the services offered in the app at any time should it identify heightened security risks or faults as well as for the purpose of performing maintenance work. Provided that WAYA exercises the level of care and due diligence customary in the industry, customers shall bear any losses suffered due to interruptions of this kind. </span></p>
    <p class="c112"><span class="c1">1.9. Assumption of damages </span></p>
    <p class="c81"><span class="c1">WAYA shall assume responsibility for damages pursuant to section 1.8 (liability) suffered by customers due to the unauthorised use of the WAYA app by third parties, provided the customers in question can demonstrate that they adhered to these GTCs and that no fault can be attributed to them in any other way. Any damages must be reported to WAYA immediately upon being identified. The damage notification form must be completed, signed and returned to WAYA within ten (10) days of receipt. </span></p>
    <p class="c114"><span class="c1">1.10. Electronic communication </span></p>
    <p class="c80"><span class="c1">Communication between WAYA and customers shall primarily take place via the WAYA app or SMS/text message solution. Where necessary, WAYA can also provide customers with notifications via e-mail provided they have saved a corresponding address. Customers shall be responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the provided address and shall also acknowledge that electronic communication is neither confidential nor secure. Such communication can be viewed, intercepted or amended by third parties or can be lost. If orders or instructions issued by customers via electronic channels are not explicitly confirmed by WAYA, customers must assume that they have not been received by WAYA. WAYA shall assume no liability for damages arising in connection with notifications sent to WAYA via ordinary e-mail or another electronic message transmission system. </span></p>
    <p class="c98"><span class="c1">1.11. Changes to the GTCs </span></p>
    <p class="c9"><span class="c1">WAYA can make amendments to the GTCs at any time. Any changes shall be communicated to customers in advance in an appropriate manner. Should customers not agree to the changes, they can delete the WAYA app from their smartphone and expressly declare to WAYA that they wish to cease using the services. </span></p>
    <p class="c72"><span class="c1">1.12. Reservation of statutory regulations and local legal restrictions for usage </span></p>
    <p class="c95"><span class="c1">Any statutory provisions that govern the operation and use of smartphones, the Internet and other dedicated infrastructure shall remain reserved and shall also be applicable to these services from the time that they enter into force. </span></p>
    <p class="c106"><span class="c1">The use of the services from outside Nigeria may be subject to local legal restrictions or, under certain circumstances, breach foreign legislation. The payment function shall in principle be limited to Nigerian territory and may not be utilised abroad. </span></p>
    <p class="c119"><span class="c1">Customers shall acknowledge that circumstances may arise during the term of the business relationship that may legally obligate WAYA to block assets, report the business relationship to a responsible authority or terminate the business relationship. Upon request, customers shall be obligated to provide WAYA with information that it requires to meet its statutory clarification or reporting obligations. </span></p>
    <p class="c116"><span class="c1">1.13. Intellectual property </span></p>
    <p class="c161"><span class="c1">For the duration of the agreement, customers shall receive the non-transferable, non-exclusive right to use the WAYA app. The content and scope of this right are governed by these GTCs. All intellectual property rights shall remain with WAYA or the entitled third parties. Should customers breach third party intellectual property rights and WAYA be held responsible, the customer in question shall fully indemnify WAYA. </span></p>
    <p class="c122"><span class="c1">1.14. Duration and termination </span></p>
    <p class="c52"><span class="c1">The business relationship between customers and WAYA shall be concluded for an indefinite period. Customers can delete the WAYA app at any time and both contracting parties can terminate the business relationship in writing at any point. </span></p>
    <p class="c150"><span class="c1">1.15. Customer-initiated block </span></p>
    <p class="c140"><span class="c1">Customers shall be required to submit a request to WAYA for their WAYA credit and thus access to the payment function to be blocked. Any payments initiated prior to the time that this request is made shall be deemed to have been booked and cannot be reversed. </span></p>
    <p class="c22"><span class="c1">1.16. Changes to services and blocking of access by WAYA </span></p>
    <p class="c46"><span class="c1">WAYA can amend, update or enhance the services at any time. WAYA shall also be authorised to fully or partially discontinue the operation of the WAYA app or the customer&rsquo;s access to the WAYA app at any time without providing prior notification and shall likewise be entitled to restrict the WAYA app&rsquo;s availability for technical or legal reasons (e.g. due to legal or regulatory requirements, upon receipt of an official order or for security reasons). </span></p>
    <p class="c110"><span class="c1">1.17. Severability clause </span></p>
    <p class="c128"><span class="c1">Should a provision of these GTCs be fully or partially invalid or ineffective, this shall not affect the validity of the other provisions. In such cases, WAYA and its customers shall undertake to replace the ineffective provision with a provision that best approximates the meaning and purpose of the original. </span></p>
    <p class="c34"><span class="c1">1.18. Applicable law and place of jurisdiction </span></p>
    <p class="c147 c154"><span class="c1">To the extent permitted by law, all legal relationships between customers and WAYA shall be exclusively subject to Nigerian substantive law with the exclusion of the law on the conflict of laws and any international treaties. Subject to the existence of mandatory statutory provisions to the contrary, the sole place of jurisdiction for all proceeding types shall be Lagos. </span></p>
    <p class="c146"><span class="c1">2. Payment functions </span></p>
    <p class="c147 c162"><span class="c1">2.1. No interest shall be paid on WAYA credit. </span></p>
    <p class="c92"><span class="c1">2.2. Topping up, releasing and processing of credit </span></p>
    <p class="c64"><span class="c1">WAYA credit shall be topped up by customers via the options designated for this purpose in the app or via the SMS/text message solution. Depending on the selected top-up option, use of the payment function (see section 2.4) and the topping up of credit can coincide. However, such instances shall involve two transactions, with it first always being necessary to top up the WAYA credit before making a subsequent payment. Any transaction fees or other charges associated with the topping up of credit must be borne by the customer in question. </span></p>
    <p class="c14"><span class="c1">No interest shall be paid on WAYA credit. </span></p>
    <p class="c143"><span class="c1">Customers shall only be able to make payments using WAYA credit if they have a positive balance. </span></p>
    <p class="c33"><span class="c1">In cases in which a direct debit (LSV) is set up, customers shall issue WAYA with authorisation to disclose certain data to third parties for the purpose of a credit rating check. </span></p>
    <p class="c10"><span class="c1">2.3. Reference account </span></p>
    <p class="c91"><span class="c1">For regulatory reasons, released WAYA credit must be transferred to a reference account. The reference account must be held in the name of the customer with a bank licensed in Nigeria. </span></p>
    <p class="c27"><span class="c1">2.4. Payment function </span></p>
    <p class="c147 c165"><span class="c1">Customers can make cashless payments using their smartphone and the associated WAYA credit at appropriately equipped shop cash registers (at points of sale &ndash; POS), vending machines, online, in other apps by saving WAYA as a payment method with selected merchants and to other customers in accordance with the applicable limits. </span></p>
    <p class="c41"><span class="c1">Upon making a payment using WAYA credit, the relevant payment amount shall be deducted directly from the WAYA credit. Customers shall acknowledge all payments booked to the WAYA credit that have been executed in connection with their smartphone and in keeping with the following security levels. In the WAYA app settings, customers shall be free to choose the amounts from which payments should be made a) automatically or b) after they have provided express confirmation (&ldquo;OK&rdquo; button). Customers can adjust the limits proposed and saved accordingly by WAYA. Settings that have been made can be changed at any time. This does not apply to payments made with merchants for which customers have saved WAYA as a payment method and where they have issued general payment approval (irrespective of the purchase amount). In such cases, the payment is executed automatically in accordance with the process defined by the merchant in question. </span></p>
    <p class="c113"><span class="c1">In the case of P2P payments, the mobile number may also be used to find the other customer. Provided that customers have issued the relevant access approval, WAYA shall be authorised to access existing contacts in the payer&rsquo;s smartphone in connection with such payments. </span></p>
    <p class="c25"><span class="c1">Upon saving WAYA as a payment method, customers shall authorise the merchant in question to debit the relevant amount directly from their WAYA credit without them being required to authorise individual charges. To save WAYA as a payment method, customers must register with the relevant merchant. Authorisation of this kind granted to a merchant can be revoked by the customer in the WAYA app at any time. Customers can only renew expired or deactivated registrations with the merchant. </span></p>

            <li> Campaigns launched by WAYA or the WAYA system (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;issuer campaigns&rdquo;). </li>

    <p class="c48"><span class="c1">It shall be possible for customers to redeem other campaign offers without activating them in advance in the WAYA app. Many campaigns can only be redeemed upon making payments with the WAYA app. </span></p>
    <p class="c61"><span class="c1">The activation of a campaign or the receipt of a campaign offer that can be redeemed without activation shall not always mean that customers are entitled to make use of a discount or non-cash benefit, as the number of redemptions may be limited by the involved third party provider.
